This repo contains source files for my musical compositions written in the
[LilyPond](http://lilypond.org) text input language.

The copyright and license information for each source file can be found in each
file's header, and the corresponding license texts reside in the
[LICENSES](./LICENSES) directory. This practice aligns with the FSFE
[REUSE](https://reuse.software) initiative.
